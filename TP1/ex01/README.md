# HOW TO USE
The file `exercise_1a.c` contain the Forward Substitution method.
The file `exercise_1b.c` contain the Back Substitution method.

Compile any file using GCC with the following command :
```shell
> gcc exercise_1a.c -o ex1a
```
Start the program and enter the requested information :
```shell
> ./ex1a
Enter the size of the matrix: 3
Filling the matrix A
A[0][0] = 4
A[0][1] = 0
A[0][2] = 0
A[1][0] = 2
A[1][1] = 3
A[1][2] = 0
A[2][0] = 8
A[2][1] = 6
A[2][2] = 1
Filling the matrix B
B[0] = 1
B[1] = 2
B[2] = -3
```
The result will be :
```shell
> The resulting vector: [0.250000,0.500000,-8.000000]
```
